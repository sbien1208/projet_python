Diabetic Patient Dataset Analysis

Overview 
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information on diabetic patients. The primary objectives include preprocessing the data, performing data visualization and building predictive models to understand factors influencing the time people spend in hospitals.

 Task Accomplishments
1.	Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data:
•	Removed the ‘weight’ column due to zero entries.
•	Employed appropriate methods to handle missing values in other columns.
Categorical Data Transformation:
•	Replaced numerical codes with descriptive categories for better interpretability.
Dealing with Redundancy:
•	Identified and removed columns with constant values throughout the dataset.

2.	Data Visualization
•	Percentage of payer code insurance company (pie chart)
•	Readmission per ethnicity (bars chart)
•	Distribution of the number of medical procedures depending on age (bars chart)
•	Readmission based on age (bars chart
•	Readmission based on race and gender (bars chart)
•	Importance of features (bars chart)
•	Time in hospital by age group (boxplot)
•	Average time in hospital on the number of medications (bars chart)
•	Distribution of time in hospital (bars chart)





3.	Modeling 
•	Employed various machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn.
•	Optimized hyperparameters through grid search.
•	Compared model performances using graphical representations.
We used many prediction algorithms, the efficiency was very difficult to reach because the dataset contains a lot of data and the best accuracy is equal to 0.27.
Furthermore, we changed the hyperparameter values to see the impact on model efficiency.

Conclusion
•	Visualizations have provided insights into age distribution, demographic compositions, readmission patterns, and prevalent diagnoses among diabetic patients.
•	Machine learning models have been applied and optimized to predict the time spend in hospitals with results compared and evaluated.
